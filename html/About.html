      <p>Tupperware is an American household products company that develops, manufactures, and internationally distributes preparation, storage, and serving containers for the kitchen and home. It was founded in 1942 by Earl Tupper, who developed his first bell-shaped container and introduced the products to the public in 1946. 
        <br>

        Earl Tupper (1907–1983) asked for pure polyethylene pellets from Dupont to build Tupperware products in 1938. He developed the first product in 1946 in Leominster, Massachusetts. The polyethylene plastic containers could be used in households to contain food and keep them airtight, and featured a "burping seal" that was patented in 1949. 
        <br>
        The product became notable with a sale-through-presentation idea, held in a party setting. Tupperware developed a direct marketing strategy known as the party plan to sell products. The party plan called Tupperware party enabled women of the 1950s to earn an income while keeping their focus in the domestic domain.Brownie Wise (1913–1992), a former sales representative of Stanley Home Products, started organizing more of these parties and was soon made vice president of marketing in 1951.Later, she created Tupperware Parties Inc.
        During the early 1950s Tupperware products gained popularity and sales increased. The company continued the Tupperware parties and rewarded top-selling women.</p>
